Personal config files that I like to take everywhere.

.zshrc - fix my laptop's pg-up/pg-dn/etc keys, set prompt, and use awesome aliases of awesome.
.vimrc - lots of custom key mappings, especially to improve buffer/tab management without the need for a plugin.
.tmux.conf - simple tabs at bottom, and start repl's for development environment
.screenrc - fancy-schmancy bottom toolbar with time, hostname etc. i tend to use this on servers, as screen is already there.

I've also got an INSTALL script that does my linking, so all I have to do on any new box is git clone, then run the INSTALL, and all my settings are there and happy forever.

Please, take whatever you can from them (unless you find some errant RSA key or password!)
